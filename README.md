# Hangman_Game
Hangman is game where you have to guess a word by guessing letters that may or maynot be in a given word. if the guessed letter is in the word then all the position the letter is in the word is revealed else if the letter in not in the word you get a strike. 
A player wins the game if he is able to guess all the letters in the word before getting 6 strikes.
In this project i have made a Model based that was an extention on the API provided by Trexquant, the goal for this challege was to achieve atleast 50% accuracy by training a model a dictionary of 250K words and an additional 100K words for testing exclusively 
The model I made is based on N-gram, and was able to achieve an accuracy of 56%, the code can be run if you have the API key provided by Trexquant, the key given in the code expirerd on completion of the assignment.

This project was made as a part of Trexquant's Hangman Game Challenge which a part of their recruitment process, I donot encourage anyone to submit the same code if they are given the same challenge for their hire.
